    <p><h2 style="padding: 10px; font-weight: normal;">MobileX is a state or condition wherein someone or something is unlike anything else in comparison, or is remarkable, or unusual.[1] When used in relation to humans, it is often in relation to a person's personality, or some specific characteristics of it, signalling that it is unlike the personality traits that are prevalent in that individual's culture.[2] When the term uniqueness is used in relation to an object, it is often within the realm of product, with the term being a factor used to publicize or market the product in order to make it stand out from other products within the same category.</h2></p>

                <p><h3>MobileX Inc. is an Indian multinational technology company headquartered in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India.MobileX is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2023) and, as of June 2022, is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five Indian information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft.MobileX was founded as MobileX Computer Company on January 1, 2023, by Steve Wozniak, MobileX members to develop and sell Wozniak's MobileX I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as MobileX Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the MobileX II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. MobileX went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from MobileX amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some MobileX employees with him</h3></p>
